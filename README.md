🧃 JuiceBox Pro
JuiceBox Pro is a defensive options terminal built for traders who prioritize income and capital preservation. By focusing on "Juice" (extrinsic value), the app identifies high-yield opportunities in Deep In-the-Money (ITM) Covered Calls, Standard OTM Covered Calls, and Cash Secured Puts.

🚀 Key Features
Multi-Strategy Scanner: Instantly scan for Deep ITM Covered Calls, OTM Covered Calls, and Cash Secured Puts.

The "Juice" Metric: Automatically calculates pure extrinsic value to show exactly how much "rent" you are collecting.

Market Sentiment Ticker: Real-time tracking of the S&P 500 and VIX (Fear Index) to gauge market volatility.

Leveraged Asset Support: Built-in universe for high-volatility assets like SOXL, TQQQ, TNA, and BOIL.

Earnings Safety Guard: Visual alerts for companies reporting earnings within the next 45 days to avoid "earnings crush".

Interactive Charts: Integrated TradingView technical charts for every ticker.

Data Export: Download your custom scan results as a CSV for offline logging and analysis.
